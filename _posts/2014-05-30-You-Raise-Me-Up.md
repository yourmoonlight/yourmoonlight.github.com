###You Raise Me Up  ---Westlife
When I am down and, oh my soul

so weary

When troubles come and my heart

burdened be

Then, I am still and wait here in the

silence

Until you come and sit a while with 

me

You raise me up, so I can stand on

mountains

You raise me up, to walk on stormy

seas

I am strong, when I am on your 

shoulders

You raise me up To more than I 

can be

You raise me up, so I can stand on

mountains

You raise me up, to walk on stormy

seas

I am strong, when I am on your 

shoulders

You raise me up To more than I 

can be

You raise me up so I can stand on 

mountains

you raise me up to walk on stormy

seas

I am strong, when I am on your 

shoulders

You raise me up To more than I 

can be

You raise me up, so I can stand on

mountains

You raise me up, to walk on stormy

seas

I am strong, when I am on your 

shoulders

You raise me up To more than I 

can be

You raise me up To more than I 

can be

END
